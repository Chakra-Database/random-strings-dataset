## Why

- `Chakra` benchmarking needs multiple Billions of keys and values
- `Chakra` test suite generates random strings used as keys and values during testing

## How it works

- Random keys generated during testing are appended into per-run files
- These files are then checked into this repository for re-use in benchmarking

## How to contribute

- Run `Chakra` test suite
- Send a pull request to submit your `chakra.randomstrings.aof` file

## How many random strings

Idea is to have `at least 10 Billion` random strings in this repository for `Chakra` CI / CD and benchmarking

## File format

As size of generated random strings can change, size is prefixed before
appending generated random string.

Following file format is used for random keys storage:

```bash
===========================================================
| random string size (64 bits) | random string bytes | ....
===========================================================
```

## Future work

Once there are too many keys of different sizes, we might consider adding a
`Chakra` index file to this repository.

This will allow for quick access and bucketing of random strings by their sizes.
